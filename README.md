## Project information

Author: Cem Kupeli

Dates worked on: August 2020

Purpose: Create a historical strategy game based on the Mongol-Chinese conflict

## Summary

This is a strategy game I wrote in August 2020 using Lua with LÃ–VE. The game is based on the Mongol-Chinese conflict, and it provides simple instructions that the user can follow to progress through the game. The "enter" key is used as a state changer throughout the game, so the user will move through the storyline by clicking enter. Inside battle scenes, the user will be able to see information about the army that they control and the army that they are facing, and they will be prompted at different times during the battle for a choice. The main concern in each battle is morale, as when an army's morale reaches zero, it loses the battle. There are three battles the user can play, and the user can attempt each battle an unlimited amount of times.

## How to run

There are two ways to run the game. Either way, downloading Love from this link (https://love2d.org/#download) and making sure the file is unzipped is necessary. After doing so, you can drag the project file (the file called "Khan") onto Love's icon (you can place Love on your taskbar to do this). Another way of running the project after downloading Love is enabling the Love2D support extension if you are using VS Code, dragging the project folder onto a new window, and then pressing CMD + L while the window is open. This will automatically run the game as long as the folder is open in the current window and the open editor is a .lua file from within the project.
